# Final Project for NIT3213
To build a mobile application, we first need the following:
- Tools: Android Studio
- Programming Language: Kotlin

### How to build the project?
Once the tools have been installed, we can get started with the steps on building the app.

**Step 1**: Create a new project and select "Empty Views Activity". Then name your file whatever you want to name it (e.g. Final App). Ensure the location is saved in the AndroidStudio projects directory, and the build configuration is Kotlin DSL. <br>

**Step 2**: After creating the project, we can get started with coding our mobile application.
